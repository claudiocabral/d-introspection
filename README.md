### Introspection in the D programming language.

This repository contains examples and explanations on how to use D's
metaprogramming capabilities. If you don't know D yet, here are a couple of
usefull ressources:

* [https://dlang.org/](http://ddili.org/ders/index.html) - Official D language
  website
* [http://ddili.org/ders/index.html](http://ddili.org/ders/index.html) Ali
  Ã‡ehreli's D language book
* [https://wiki.dlang.org/](https://wiki.dlang.org)


Great videos about D:
* [Ali's talk introducing D to C++
  programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYEKEIpM2zo&t=4103s)
* [Andrei's talk about Design By
  Introspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29h6jGtZD-U)


I plan to introduce more ressources and improve this to be a proper tutorial in
the future. Contributions are more then welcome.
